    <p class="wraps">She-Hulk was a very weird show to say the least. There were points where I either thought it was a lot of fun and there were points where I completely zoned out 
        while watching, due to lack of interest. Starting off, I think the main actress, Tatiana Maslany, was very well-casted and she fit the role of She-Hulk/Jennifer Walters very well. She brought
         great comedic timing, she fit the role as a lawyer perfectly, and she also looked like she was having a lot of fun playing the character. That being said, the 
         biggest flaw that this show has is the writing. The episodes are completely inconsistent in terms of quality. The show starts out with Jen’s origin story, which felt 
         incredibly rushed. I really didn’t like this fast origin story because it made becoming a Hulk just seem like a common everyday occurrence. I didn’t feel the weight of the 
         situation nearly as much simply because it was glossed over and finished within a 40 minute or so episode. Jen simply goes back to her life as a lawyer. After she returns, 
         she is quickly recruited to be the new head lawyer of a superhero law firm. For the most part, the plot of each episode is a different court case that Jen handles. These can
          range from very fun ones like the one involving Wong and a reject magician, or ones that kind of seem to drag, like the one case involving Mr. Immortal’s numerous spouses. 
          The court case episodes are definitely a mixed bag and could either be entertaining or bland. There also are episodes that involve Jen’s everyday life. One episode in 
          particular that I found to be very boring was the one where she is invited to a wedding, so the entire episode is just a wedding episode. They even make a joke about how 
          this wedding episode disrupts the flow of the show, which they justify by saying “because weddings always disrupt people lives.” Sure, that is true, but it still makes the 
          episode feel pointless regardless. That inconsistency of episode quality and writing quality is present throughout the entire show causing it to feel rushed along, which is
           crazy considering that this is the longest Disney Plus marvel show to date. It’s shame too because I really liked the supporting cast such as her paralegal and her 
           coworker as well as the surprise appearances such as Wong, Abomination, and Daredevil (which, not going to lie, was a major reason why I wanted to watch the show). Jen's 
           arc throughout the show was great too, with her initially feeling overshadowed by her own She-Hulk personally, but that plotline feels like it takes a backseat to all the
           other random shenanigans that happen, such as the underlying villain plot that goes absolutely no where. The ending was fun, but it still made every other episode seem
           a bit pointless. This 
           project definitely feels like a product rather than a show made by passionate people.</p>
