    <p class="wraps">It is as simple as it seems, Wild Croc Territory is about a team of crocodile wranglers going around and catching crocs. While each episode does varry, they 
        generally stick to the same formula, being: Get a report about a crocodile problem, head to the location with large metal cage walls and other equipment, set up a trap in a
        good area, wait until the next day or so to see if the trap worked, and then wrangle and rescue/recolcate the croc.One fun part about it each time they go to catch a new croc
         is that they will give it a fitting name, a prime example being the croc from episode one named Beef Cheeks. While it can be slow in some parts, the suspenseful action of 
         catching the croc makes it worth it. This normally happens when they trap the croc and then have to wrangle it with rope, and the sheer intensity in these scenes make it 
         very gripping. Additionally, given a less car-suited environment, they will have to fly a helicopter, to move the metal pieces for the cage, but what's really humorous to 
         watch when they have to airlift out a crocodile in a net. It's not only crazy to see a croc being carried in a helicopter, but it's somewhat unreal when you see the team 
         have to wrangle a large 15 to 17 foot croc that probably weighs anywhere about 500+ lbs. The show doesn’t fully focus on catching crocs the entire show, and in some parts 
         takes a break to show some more chill stuff like fishing or catching crabs and crayfish, or the really casual event of catching a bull shark in a river. Personally for me I
          am a big fan of crocodiles, so it was very entertaining to watch and I enjoyed the entire show, but I do understand that it's not everyone's cup of tea.</p>
