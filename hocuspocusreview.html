    <p class="wraps">Hocus Pocus 2 was an interesting movie to review. Watching the 1993 original and the sequel back-to-back for the first time was a great double feature for the 
        spooky season. I would only suggest seeing the second installment of the Hocus Pocus franchise if you thoroughly enjoyed the first one. I found that a few of the elements for
         the second movie were questionable. It really seemed like a money grab to me seeing a few choices they made for the movie really dragged down the overall experience. 
         I didn’t really enjoy the second one over the first one.</p>
