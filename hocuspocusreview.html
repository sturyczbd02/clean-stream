    <p class="wraps">Hocus Pocus 2 was an interesting movie to review. Watching the 1993 original and the sequel back-to-back for the first time was a great double feature for the 
        spooky season. I would only suggest seeing the second installment of the Hocus Pocus franchise if you thoroughly enjoyed the first one and want to see the beloved characters
         again. I found that a few of the elements for the second movie were questionable. Pandering is the thought that immediately came to mind for this movie. I am not nostalgic 
         for the original film but the way the second movie played out felt very half-hearted. When thinking of a sequel that takes this long of a break between installments, you 
         would hope that the writers would really take their time with the elements and dialogue they want to put in the film. It really seemed like a money grab to me seeing a few
          choices they made for the movie really dragged down the overall experience. However, that is how I feel, and if you just want to see your beloved characters again, I will
           not stop you from watching it. I didn’t really enjoy the second one over the first one and I’m sure a lot of you will agree, just leave it as is don’t add a second 
           installment if it’s not going to hold up to the first. I give Hocus Pocus 2 a 6/10… I give Hocus Pocus a 8/10.</p>
