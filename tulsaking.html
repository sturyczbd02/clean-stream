    <p class="wraps">Following his release from prison, mafia capo Dwight "The General" Manfredi played by Silvester Stallone, is exiled 
        to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he builds a new criminal empire with a group of unlikely characters. I enjoyed Stallone's rather fresh 
        slant on the predictable but well-crafted dialogue and plot.  It seemed to me that Stallone has been waiting for this role since 
        Rocky I.  It fits him like a glove.  The violence is handled with both humor and sincerity. While children should not watch this,
        the violence seems obviously necessary rather than gratuitous. A simple Mafia plot, with some nifty dialogue with Stallone proving
         he knows how to deliver dry humor, or his point, when saying certain lines. For 25 years he didn't sing on his boss while in the 
         slammer. When he gets out, he learns he has been dumped and asked to go to no manâ€™s land Oklahoma to start from scratch. He lost 
         his wife, daughter, and the life he led for this face slap, but goes anyway to prove he still has a nose for business. This role 
         is made for him, perhaps a role that he had to grow into from an age perspective. What makes Stallone's moments funnier is as he 
         quickly takes over new financial business in Oklahoma, he is also learning his way around the new world and new technology. Best 
         role Stallone has played in a long time. If Tulsa King doesn't stray down the mind-numbing path of Dallas and Yellowstone, it 
         could be quite exceptional.</p>
