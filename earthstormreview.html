    <p class="wraps">Picture this, devastating tornadoes, erupting volcanoes, trembling earthquakes, and fierce hurricanes. All of these natural disasters are covered in Earthstorm,
         showing the risks of where people live and how they can lay waste to populated areas. Whether it is a tornado leveling an entire factory building or a hurricane that leads 
         to 6 to 7 foot high floodwaters, each episode shows just how serious each of these are. Overall, I thought the show was very interesting to watch and with it being only 4 
         episodes, it wasn't so long that I felt like it was dragged out. I would say it was partially educational, but that didnâ€™t seem to take away the enjoyment from watching the 
         show. There are slow parts in each episode, but it really grabbed my attention when showing footage from any of the disasters they mentioned. It really hit home seeing the 
         sheer magnitude and alarm, and after watching each episode, it gave me a better understanding of natural disasters. I would probably say that one should want to have an 
         interest or curiosity in watching and learning about natural disasters before watching this show, because otherwise it will not be a good watch. My favorite episode was the 
         one on volcanoes because it's something that you'd hear about the least from the 4 disasters that were covered(tornadoes, volcanoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes), and 
         seeing the footage of an active volcano erupting is captivating.</p>
