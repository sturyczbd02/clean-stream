    <p class="wraps">Wendell & Wild is the newest installment in the stop-motion-animation scene. With creative direction from Jordan Peele and henry Selick, Wendell & Wild explore 
        the rundown town of Rustbank. Without getting too into the story, I found the movie to have a lot of interesting plot points and characters. The unique art style for the stop
         motion makes it stand out on its own like its predecessors. If you enjoy the creepy themes from Coraline, this may be a new seasonal classic for you to enjoy. Though I 
         enjoyed the characters, art style and direction it was going in, I felt it didn’t really focus enough on the main story. The numerous storylines, while interesting and add
          to their characters, ultimately I think took away from the main character. I felt the same way with another Netflix film that had a strong start but fell weak by the third
           act of the film. I really hope that the next few animated originals, including Guillermo del Toro’s interpretation of the story Pinocchio takes time and fulfills each part
            of the film. Perhaps cutting out a few characters would have better focused the story. Seeing how Jordan Peele has produced several successful and fulfilling stories, I 
            am bit surprised he didn’t make the movie for a more mature audience.</p>
