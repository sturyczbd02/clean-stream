    <p class="wraps">Werewolf By Night was a ton of fun. This was the first Marvel “special presentation” on Disney Plus, which basically is a short movie. The movie’s runtime is 
        only 53 minutes, which made it digestible and was a nice change of pace for Marvel content, where it would either be an entire series or a 2 hour minimum movie. The fact 
        that the story was able to work within this timeframe, while still being refreshing and exciting is an achievement to the writers, directors, etc. that were behind this 
        short movie. I thought the plot was really well done, where it was centered around a competitive hunt that involves several established and respected monster hunters. Whoever
         is able to kill the beast found in the arena is then rewarded the Bloodstone, which was recently possessed by the prestigious monster hunter, Ulysses Bloodstone. The two 
         notable characters in this story is Jack Russell, a relatively unknown monster hunter with a dark secret and ulterior motive, and Elsa Bloodstone, the disconnected daughter 
         of Ulysses. I found this plot to be really interesting because I’ve never seen this supernatural side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe before. It felt like I just entered 
         the realm of a classic horror movie. It didn’t even feel like the typical superhero movie, despite being a Marvel product. I enjoyed the twists and turns in the plot, which 
         I won’t outright say because I don’t want to spoil. I will say that one important aspect of the special resides in the title itself. The two main characters felt 
         surprisingly fleshed out despite being introduced within a 53-minute special. Nothing ever felt rushed or crammed in, which greatly surprised me because of that 
         aforementioned runtime. The way the special was presented too was incredibly unique. It was produced almost entirely in black and white and with a grain to evoke the 
         feeling of a classic monster movie. I say “almost” because the Bloodstone is the only thing that is full of color in most scenes it is present in. This contrast emphasized 
         the Bloodstone and made it seem incredibly important. It also looks incredibly visually appealing as well. I absolutely adored this stylistic choice because it made the 
         whole experience completely unique from anything that I’ve seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Using this black and white color palette meant that the lighting needed to
          be emphasized. The special definitely achieved that feat by making the dimly-lit arena still feel full of depth and atmosphere. There was one scene in particular where the
           Werewolf character attacks a whole hallway of goons that looked absolutely amazing. You’ll know which scene I mean when you watch it. The only thing that I disliked about 
           this special was that I felt like it wasn’t long enough. I feel like if it was 10 or 20 minutes more, it would have felt a lot more conclusive. It was still a blast to 
           watch and it was awesome to watch during Halloween time! </p>
