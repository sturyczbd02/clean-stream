    <p class="wraps">While hanging out after school, Charlie and his friends discover the headquarters of the world's most powerful 
        superhero hidden beneath his home. When villains attack, they must team up to defend the headquarters and save the world. Fast 
        paced and heartfelt, “Secret Headquarters” assumes its young audience has a basic cultural literacy without shoving in clumsy 
        social media references that often feel like dad jokes (though Reddit does get a shoutout). With a PG-rated humor that parents 
        can enjoy too, “Secret Headquarters” feels like the movie equivalent of the fun uncle who speaks to you like an adult, but also 
        drives a mean Mario Kart. Like a cross between “Home Alone” and “Spy Kids,” each funny character brings their own special sauce 
        to the adventure. Blending a teenage girl’s frivolity with math whiz skills, Lizzie gets some of the funnier lines. A Britney 
        Spears reference is followed with, “Hasn’t she been through enough?” and she defends Jack’s choice of accessory for his magic 
        suit with: “I actually think fanny packs are really having a moment right now.” The well-timed one liners and casual asides 
        abound, all credit to the script, which was written by Schulman and Joost along with Josh Koenigsberg. Scobell is charismatic 
        and natural as the film’s boyish lead, but the other kids each have their charms, and no one feels like an afterthought. Peña 
        is particularly funny as the evil Algorn, playing up the physical comedy with Wilson in their silly final battle. All in all, 
        “Secret Headquarters” makes for a very entertaining ride for kids and adults.</p>
